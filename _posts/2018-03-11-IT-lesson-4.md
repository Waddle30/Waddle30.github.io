  <tr>
    <td>I learnt via a strategy where jai and I put the first word of each line down on the screen. We did this so if we had to pack up, we would know what to do next time. Also, we sometimes asked other people for help. The code booklet helps a lot. I don't know where we would be without it.</td>

    <td>this time, not many things limited my learning. One of the only things that limited our learning was concentration. For some parts of the lesson I had my head in the clouds. I need to work on concentrating more in lessons.</td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try and concentrate more. Next time I am doing 1.4 roundup, which will require the majority of the code I have used so far and a lot of time.</td>
