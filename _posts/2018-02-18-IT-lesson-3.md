    <th>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</th>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by following the instructions and also asking other people. I put the notepad of the code behind the keyboard just so I could see it, which helped me a lot, since jai wasn't here.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited by learning was that jai (my partner) wasnâ€™t there for the majority of the lesson, so I had to multitask. When he came, we got back up to our usual pace</td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will speed up my typing so I can catch up with the others. However, I now know how to save files onto my USB stick.</td>
