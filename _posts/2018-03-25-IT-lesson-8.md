    <td>Today, jai and I loaded up 1.4 roundup, and found out it was actually already complete. So we got onto fuze 2. We used our first word strategy. I also realised this lesson what CLS meant; clear screen. Jai and I managed to complete the whole of fuze 2. If we continue at this rate, we might catch up with the others next monday!</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>this week what limited our learning was a saving problem. We kept trying to save a file that just wouldn't show up on our USB sticks. When we tried saving it under the same name for the second time it says there is already a file named this. Eventually jai and I sorted it out.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, jai and I will be on to fuze 4, which involves lights. The people near us have been struggling with this section so I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if we did to. Next time we hopefully won't run into the saving problem again.</td>
