    <td>this lesson, mr ampha-korsa wasn't here for the majority of the lesson. Today since jai also wasn’t here for the majority of the lesson, I was working with Conor, because his partner ditched him for one of his friends. We took long setting up, and we found 4.1 very difficult. We asked the people around us who had done it and they shown us how to set up the circuits.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>what limited our learning was we accidentally spilt all the fuze circuit board pieces and had to find them all again and put them in their sections. We also couldn’t save it because I forgot my USB stick and Conor didn’t have his as well.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>next time, I will be doing something else in IT. Fuze has been a fun experience for me. If there was one thing they could do to improve it, it would be to talk people through how to save it too the USB sticks.</td>
