    <td>This week jai and I did the same strategies as last time; typing first word of each line. We managed to get a lot of code down via this method. Although this may look like a longer method, it's easier when your finishing the lesson so you know how many lines you have for next time.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>This time we ran into a major problem. When we tested it out for the second time, jai responded to a question that we coded on but we didn’t have the code for the response. I quickly pressed f2, which meant edit. However, because of both of us, it wouldn’t let us onto the code, so we had to start again.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will make sure that we understand what the code means before we test it out so we don’t run into the code problem again. I will also copy down two sections of code before testing the project.</td>
