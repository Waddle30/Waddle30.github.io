    <td>Today, we started doing python, on codecademy. Unlike fuze, we did this by ourselves. Since I wasn't there last week, I had some catching up to do. I put my head down and was completing the sections fast, with a bit of help from Conor, the person I was sitting next to. I ended on section 14 of area.</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>what limited my learning was the fact that I started one week later than others. I quickly had to set up an account on codecademy. However, I managed to almost complete section one, which I am quite happy with.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>next time, I won’t have to set up an account, and since I know what I’m doing in python, I can hopefully complete area 2 in python on codecademy.</td>
