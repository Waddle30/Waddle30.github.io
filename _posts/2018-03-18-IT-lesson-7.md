    <td>today, Mr ampah-korsah wasn't here, so we had a substitute teacher. We started the lesson differently; we started with fuze and didn’t load up our blogs. Jai and I used the strategy where we typed the first word of each line. We managed to get to the end of the script. However, there were some bugs that we couldn’t fix because it was the end of the lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>what limited our learning was some bugs. When we wrote the variables, we used them later but misspelt some of them. This took us to the end of the lesson. If we had more time, we would of finished it.</td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>

  <tr>
    <td>Next week, we will hopefully finish it for once and for all. We now know how many lines of code there are; 101 lines! However, we’re not quite sure if it saved properly onto our USB sticks. I will be very happy when we get onto 2.1.</td>
