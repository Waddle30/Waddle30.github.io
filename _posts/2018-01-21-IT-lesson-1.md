    <td>This week not many mistakes happened. When they did happen, Jai (my partner) and I pointed it out to each other. We followed the instructions and got through the stages 1.1 and 1.2.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>When we were trying to save our work, we didn't realise we had to wait until the Lightning symbol disappeared, meaning we lost 1.2. We also did 1.3, but when we were about to save it, the tab somehow deleted itself, meaning we had to start over. If these mistakes didn’t happen, then we would of got onto 1.4 and possibly 1.5.</td>

    <td>Today Jai and I didn’t manage to get our code onto our USB sticks because we couldn’t figure out how to do it. I will find out how to transfer files to a USB stick in my spare time so hopefully this will never occur again.</td>
