    <td>In today's lesson, I realised I had actually completed section 1. This meant I could start on section 2. I raced through section 2 and 3 (3 was only 6 parts) and managed to complete a chunk of section 4. I asked the person sitting next to me for help sometimes and I followed the instructions given in the program, making me able to get that far.</td>

    <td>In today's lesson, I got distracted a few times. I believe if I didnâ€™t get distracted and typed faster as well, I could of finished section 4.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>next time, I will try to not be as distracted as today. I will also try to not ask the person sitting next to me for help, so I will learn better. This will hopefully lead to me completing section 4, and maybe even section 5!</td>
