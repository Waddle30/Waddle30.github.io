    <td>jai and I learnt via the same strategies as previous times; first word strategy and asking other people. We find both strategies very useful. I had to point out to jai that the all of the code was meant to be in one page. We also used the strategy where you only run your code after 2 or more bits of code.</td>

    <td>at the end of this lesson, jai and I ended at the same point as last time; at the beginning. The reason for this was the majority of the time we ran our code, it shown a blank screen. When we tried loading our code up, we realised we hadn't saved it properly. We then asked the people next to us if they could show us how to save it properly again.</td>
